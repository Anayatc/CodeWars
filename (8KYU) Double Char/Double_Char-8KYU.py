def double_char(s):
    return ''.join(c * 2 for c in s)

'''
Description:

Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

double_char("String") ==> "SSttrriinngg"

double_char("Hello World") ==> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"

double_char("1234!_ ") ==> "11223344!!__  "
Good Luck!
