def reverse(st):
    return ' '.join(st.split(' ')[::-1])

'''
Description:

You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:

reverse('Hello World') == 'World Hello'
reverse('Hi There.') == 'There. Hi'
Happy coding!
