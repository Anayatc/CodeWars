# CodeWars

## Python Kata Solutions
This repository contains all the solutions for the Kata(challenges) I have completed in Python. Each problem is contained inside of it's own directory, each directory contains a `readme.md` which contains the description for the kata, and the solution as a `.py` file.

## Porject Objectives
The objective behind completing katas on CodeWars is to drill in the core foundations of python programming, for the standard library to become second nature. Each kata is ranked, and the ranking works by going from 8kyu all the way to 1kyu, 8kyu being the easiest and 1kyu being the hardest, my ultimate goal is to able to easily solve solutions at a higher rank level as I get better at programming.

## Stack Elements
1. All my solutions are in python 3.6 except where the Kata explicitly makes you use python 2.7
2. Imports: This is the beauty of codewars, it makes you use a lot of imports to solve the problems, and as such there are a huge number of different modules used in this repository.

## How to Run
1. it's pointless to clone the entire reposity, just download the `.py` for the Kata solution you would like to run, 
2. run it in python shell
